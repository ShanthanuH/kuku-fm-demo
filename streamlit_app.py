Continue this Indian murder mystery set in Darjeeling. Write immersive and vivid prose like a gripping detective thriller. Continue the story in strictly 1 paragraph (not more) based on the user's decision. End with a question asking what the user wants to do next. DO NOT include any text like "User decides:" or similar - only provide the narrative continuation. Make sure that you don't end in between sentences; always end a paragraph with a question for the user. After the user answers, continue from there, generate about 50 words of continuation, and then give a question for the user again.

Case notes so far:
{story_so_far}

User chose:
{user_input}

Now continue:
